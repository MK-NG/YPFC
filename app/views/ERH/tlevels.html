       T Levels
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body choice-body">
T Levels are a qualification for students aged 16 to 19 who’ve finished their GCSEs. They are a 2-year qualification and are equivalent to 3 A levels.      </p>
       <p class="govuk-body choice-body">
You’ll spend 80% of your time in the classroom and 20% on a minimum 9-week placement with an employer, meaning you can gain industry experience while you continue your studies.
       </p>
       <p class="govuk-body choice-body">
T Levels can help you into skilled employment, higher study or apprenticeships.

  How much does a T level cost 
  </h2>
  <p>Like A levels, there are no tuition fees to study a T Level if you start before you are 19.
 </p>
  

   <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"> 
  What does a T Level include 
  </h2>
  <p>A T Level course will allow you to gain a technical qualification and learn specialist skills and knowledge for your chosen occupation or career.
 </p>

<p>T Levels include an industry placement which will last for at least 9 weeks (or 45 days) – when and how you complete it depends on the T Level, college and employer.</p>
<p>During your placement you will:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list---bullet">
    <li>
      have a line manager who will supervise and support you
    </li>
    <li>
      be provided with feedback at the end of your placement
    </li>
  </ul>
